Algorithm:
Input:
s: A string

Output:
Return the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters to the beginning of the input string s.

Steps:
1.Define the function shortest_palindrome(s):

2.If the input string s is empty (not s), return an empty string ("").

3.Reverse the input string s to get rev_s.

4.Construct a modified string l by concatenating s, a special character '#', and the reversed string rev_s.

5.Create an array p of length equal to the length of the concatenated string l and initialize it with zeros.

6.Implement the KMP algorithm to calculate the longest suffix that is also a prefix at each index in the string l:

	a. Iterate through the concatenated string l.

	b. For each index i from 1 to the length of l:

7.Determine the length of the longest suffix that is also a prefix by accessing the last element of the p array, denoted as p[-1].

8.Construct the shortest palindrome by taking a substring of the reversed string rev_s from index len(s) - p[-1] and concatenate it with the original input string s.

9.Return the constructed shortest palindrome.

LOGIC:

1.Reversal of the String:
The input string s is reversed to rev_s. This step is necessary to find the longest palindrome suffix of the original string.

2.Modified String Creation (l):
A modified string l is formed by concatenating s, a special character '#', and the reversed string rev_s. The '#' serves as a separator.

3.KMP Algorithm:
The code utilizes a variation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to calculate the longest suffix that is also a prefix at each index in the string l.
The KMP algorithm typically finds the longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix for each index in a string. In this case, the algorithm is slightly modified to find the length of the longest suffix that is also a prefix.

4.Building the Shortest Palindrome:
The KMP array p stores information about the longest suffix that is also a prefix at each index in the concatenated string l.
The length of the longest palindrome suffix in the reversed string rev_s is determined by p[-1].
The constructed shortest palindrome is obtained by taking a substring of rev_s from the calculated index (len(s) - p[-1]) and concatenating it with the original input string s.

This approach efficiently finds the shortest palindrome by identifying the longest palindromic suffix in the reversed string and appending the remaining non-palindromic part from the original string to form the shortest palindrome.
