Algorithm: Generate Pascal's Triangle

Input: numRows(number of rows to generate in Pascal's triangle)

Output: Pascal's triangle as a list of lists

1.Initialize an empty list pascals_triangle to store the rows of Pascal's triangle.

2.If numRows is 0, return an empty list since there won't be any rows in Pascal's triangle.

3.Append the first row [1] to the pascals_triangle list.

4.Iterate from the second row up to numRows:

        a. Get the previous row prev_row from pascals_triangle.

        b. Initialize a new list new_row with the value [1] (first element of each row).

	c. For each index j in the range from 1 to i-1 (where i is the current row number):

	d. Append 1 to the new_row (last element of each row).

	e. Append the new_row to the pascals_triangle.

5.Return the pascals_triangle containing rows representing Pascal's triangle up to numRows

LOGIC:

Initializing the triangle with the first row [1].
For each subsequent row:
	Take the last row generated.
	Start a new row with 1.
	Calculate values between the first and last element by summing up the elements from the previous row.
	Append 1 at the end of the row.
	Add the new row to the triangle.
This process continues until the desired number of rows (numRows) is achieved.

Overall, the algorithm builds Pascal's triangle row by row, each row being dependent on the row above it, 
following the adjacent values from the previous row and adding 1 at both ends to create the next row.
The dynamic programming approach optimizes the computation by reusing the previously generated rows to construct subsequent rows efficiently.
